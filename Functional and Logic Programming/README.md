# Functional and Logic Programming

### Specific professional competencies acquired
- Adequate description of programming paradigms and specific language mechanisms, as well as identification of differences between semantic and syntactic aspects.
- Elaboration of adequate source codes and unitary testing of some components in a known programming language, based on given design specifications.
- Development of program units and elaboration of corresponding documentations.
