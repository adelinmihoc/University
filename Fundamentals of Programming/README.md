# Fundamentals of Programming

### Specific professional competencies acquired:
- Description of programming paradigms and of language specific mechanisms, as well
as identification of syntactic and semantic differences.
- Explanation of existing software applications, on different levels of abstraction
(architecture, classes, methods) using adequate basic knowledge.
- Elaboration of adequate source code and testing of components in a given programming
language, based on given specifications.
- Testing applications based on testing plans.
- Developing units of programs and corresponding documentation.


## Syllabus

#### 1. Introduction to software development processes
- What is programming: algorithm, program, basic elements of the
Python language, Python interpreter, basic roles in software
engineering
- How to write programs: problem statement, requirements, feature
driven development process
- Example: calculator, iteration modelling

#### 2. Procedural programming
- Compound types: list, tuple, dictionary
- Functions: test cases, definition, variable scope, calling, parameter
passing
- Test-driven development (TDD) steps, refactoring

#### 3. Modular programming
- What is a module: Python module definition, variable scope in a
module, packages, standard module libraries, deployment
- How to organize source code: responsibilities, single responsibility
principle, separation of concerns, dependency, coupling, cohesion
- Common layers in an information system - logical architecture
- Eclipse + PyDev

#### 4. User defined types
- How to define new data types: encapsulation, information hiding
(data hiding in Python), guidelines, abstract data types

#### 5. Design guidelines
- Problem statement: a program for managing information (CRUD
operations)
- Layered architecture: UI layer, application layer, domain layer,
infrastructure layer
- GRASP patterns
- Example of application development: entity, validator, repository,
controller
- Principles: information expert, low coupling, high cohesion,
protected variation, single responsibility, dependency injection

#### 6. Object based programming
- Objects and classes: classes, objects, fields, methods, special class
methods (operator overloading), Python scope and namespace
- UML Diagrams: class diagrams, relationships, associations,
invariants
- Inheritance: UML generalization, code reuse, overriding, inheritance
in Python
- Exceptions
- Example: working with files in Python, repository implementations
using files

#### 7. Program design
- Top down and bottom up strategies: top down design, bottom up
design, bottom up programming style, mixed approach
- Organizing the UI
- Class invariants

#### 8. Program testing and inspection
- Testing methods: exhaustive testing, black box testing, white box
testing
- Testing levels: unit testing, integration testing
- Automated testing, TDD
- Program inspection: coding style, refactoring

#### 9. Recursion
- Notion of recursion
- Direct and indirect recursion
- Examples

#### 10. Algorithm complexity
- Empiric analysis and asymptotic analysis
- Asymptotic notation: big-o, little-o, big-omega, little-omega, theta;
properties
- Examples of magnitude orders
- Comparison of algorithm

#### 11. Searching. Sorting.
- Specification of the searching/sorting problem
- Search methods: sequential, binary.
- Sort methods: BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort,
MergeSort
- Complexity of searching/sorting algorithms

#### 12. Problem solving methods (I)
- General presentation of the Greedy and Backtracking methods
- Algorithms and complexity
Examples

#### 13. Problem solving methods (II)
- General presentation of the Divide & Conquer and Dynamic
Programming methods
- Algorithms and complexity
- Examples
