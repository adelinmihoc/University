# Fundamentals of Programming

## Specific competencies acquired

#### Professional competencies:
- Description of programming paradigms and of language specific mechanisms, as well
as identification of syntactic and semantic differences.
- Explanation of existing software applications, on different levels of abstraction
(architecture, classes, methods) using adequate basic knowledge.
- Elaboration of adequate source code and testing of components in a given programming
language, based on given specifications.
- Testing applications based on testing plans.
- Developing units of programs and corresponding documentation.
#### Transversal competencies:
- Application of efficient and rigorous working rules, manifest responsible attitudes
towards the scientific and didactic fields, respecting professional and ethical principles.
- Use of efficient methods and techniques for learning, information, research and
development of abilities for knowledge exploitation, for adapting to the needs of a dynamic
society and for communication in a widely used foreign language.

## Syllabus

#### 1. Introduction to software development processes
- What is programming: algorithm, program, basic elements of the
Python language, Python interpreter, basic roles in software
engineering
- How to write programs: problem statement, requirements, feature
driven development process
- Example: calculator, iteration modelling
- 
#### 2. Procedural programming
- Compound types: list, tuple, dictionary
- Functions: test cases, definition, variable scope, calling, parameter
passing
