<h2>Inner Solar System</h2>

<p>
  <dd>The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroid belt.</dd><br>
  <dd>Composed mainly of silicates and metals, the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun;</dd> <br>
  <dd>the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.</dd> <br>
  <dd>This region is also within the frost line, which is a little less than 5 AU (about 700 million km) from the Sun.</dd> <br>
</p>
<h3>Inner Planets</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Mercury</h4></li>
  <p>
    Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets.<br>
    The smallest planet in the Solar System (0.055 M⊕), Mercury has no natural satellites. <br>
    Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history.<br>
    Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.<br>
    Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained.<br>
    Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.<br>
  </p>
  <li><h4>Venus</h4></li>
  <p>
  Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 M⊕) and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. <br>
  It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. <br>
  It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. <br>
  No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions. <br>
  </p>
  <aside>
  <li><h4>Earth</h4></li>
  <p>
    You know what's here!
  </p>
  </aside>
  <li><h4>Mars</h4></li>
  <p>
    Mars (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus (0.107 M⊕). <br>
    It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth).<br>
    Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago.<br>
    Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil.[90] Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.<br>
