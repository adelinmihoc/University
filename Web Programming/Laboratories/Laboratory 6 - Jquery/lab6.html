			<h2>Bruno: The next big thing for ULA is a long-endurance upper stage</h2>

					<h4>ULA is still betting on long-endurance upper stages and believes the technology has a bright future. </h4>
					<p>WASHINGTON — When United Launch Alliance started to develop its new Vulcan rocket, it envisioned using a new upper stage called ACES, short for advanced cryogenic evolved stage. ULA’s president and CEO Tory Bruno described it in 2018 as a transportation system that would operate in space for weeks or months performing missions in different orbits.ULA later changed course and decided that its Vulcan Centaur would use the Centaur 5, a larger and more powerful version of the Atlas 5 upper stage.
					Speaking April 7 at the America’s Future Series space innovation summit, Bruno said ULA is still betting on long-endurance upper stages and believes the technology has a bright future. 
					“We think it’s going to be really all about that through-space transportation, and the things that upper stages can do,” Bruno said. 
					The launch industry has mastered the ability to deliver payloads to orbit so the future is about figuring out applications that a vehicle can do after satellite deployment, said Bruno. 
					An upper stage, for example, could operate as a tug in space beyond Earth’s orbit or around the lunar orbit. The U.S. government could, for instance, use the vehicle to drop off multiple payloads on different orbits. </p>

			<h2>SpaceX launches another set of Starlink satellites as it nears global coverage</h2>
			<div class="horizontally_allign">
				<div class="box1">
					<p>WASHINGTON — SpaceX continued the rollout of its Starlink broadband constellation with another launch of 60 satellites April 7, edging closer to providing continuous global service.
					A Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 12:34 p.m. Eastern. The rocket’s upper stage deployed its payload of 60 Starlink satellites into orbit a little more than an hour later.
					The rocket’s first stage landed on a droneship in the Atlantic eight and a half minutes after liftoff. This was the seventh flight for this booster, which first launched the Demo-2 commercial crew mission last May and most recently launched another set of Starlink satellites March 11.</p>

					<h4>The U.S. Space Force is consolidating oversight of space launch activities under a two-star general who will be the deputy commander of Space Systems Command.</h4>
					<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Space Force is consolidating oversight of space launch activities under a two-star general who will have broad responsibilities for the procurement of launch services and for the operations of the military’s launch ranges.
					The Space Force plans to establish a Space Systems Command this summer in Los Angeles that will absorb the responsibilities of the Space and Missile Systems Center. The command will be led by a three-star general and a two-star deputy commander who will be in charge of launch activities. 
					The office of the deputy commander “becomes a one-stop shop for launch,” Lt. Gen. John Thompson, head of the Space and Missile Systems Center, told SpaceNews.
					The procurement of launch services today is managed by SMC’s launch enterprise which reports to SMC’s one-star deputy commander. 
					Under the new structure, the two-star SSC deputy commander also will be “program executive officer for assured access to space,” Thompson said.

			<h2>Phase Four wins Air Force contract for electric thruster development</h2>
			<div class="horizontally_allign">
				<div class="box1">
					<p>WASHINGTON — Phase Four, a startup working on electric propulsion for satellites, has won an Air Force contract to test using an alternative propellant for its thrusters.
					Phase Four announced April 8 it received a $750,000 Phase 2 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award from the U.S. Air Force’s AFWERX program to test using iodine as a propellant in the company’s Maxwell electric thrusters. The award will fund work on a prototype version of that thruster.
					Iodine offers a number of advantages over conventional propellants like xenon and krypton, said Beau Jarvis, chief executive of Phase Four, in an interview. Iodine doesn’t require high-pressure storage, saving on weight and complexity, which makes it particularly useful for small satellites where mass and volume are constrained.
					It is also potentially much cheaper, given both the reduced size and complexity of the thruster system as well as the far lower cost of iodine compared to xenon, which Phase Four has been using for its Maxwell thruster. “Well over 50% of the cost of that unit is tied up on the fluid side: the storage tank, the high-pressure valves and the cost of xenon,” he said.
