# Object Oriented Programming

### Specific professional competencies acquired:
- Description of programming paradigms and of language specific mechanisms, as well
as identification of syntactic and semantic differences.
- Explanation of existing software applications, on different levels of abstraction
(architecture, classes, methods) using adequate basic knowledge.
- Elaboration of adequate source code and testing of components in a given programming
language, based on given specifications.
- Testing applications based on testing plans.
- Developing units of programs and corresponding documentation
